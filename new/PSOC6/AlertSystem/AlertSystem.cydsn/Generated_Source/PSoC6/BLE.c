* Function Name: Cy_BLE_Start
***************************************************************************//**
* 
*  This function initializes the BLE Stack which consists of the BLE Stack 
*  Manager, BLE Controller, and BLE Host modules. It takes care of initializing
*  the Profile layer, schedulers, Timer and other platform-related
*  resources required for the BLE component. It also registers the callback 
*  function for BLE events that will be registered in the BLE stack.
* 
*  Note that this function does not reset the BLE Stack.
* 
*  For the HCI-Mode of operation, this function will not initialize the BLE Host 
*  module.
* 
*  Calling this function results in generation of a CY_BLE_EVT_STACK_ON event
*  on successful initialization of the BLE Stack.
*
*  In the Dual Core mode, this function should be called on both cores in the 
*  following sequence:
*   - call this function on CM0+ core to initialize the Controller.
*   - start CM4 core by calling Cy_SysEnableCM4() function.
*   - call this function on CM4 core to initialize the Host and Profiles.
* 
*  \param callbackFunc: Event callback function to receive events from BLE stack.
*   cy_ble_callback_t is a function pointer type.
* 
* \return
*  cy_en_ble_api_result_t : Return value indicates if the function succeeded or 
*  failed. The following are possible error codes.

*   The cy_ble_initVar variable is used to indicate the initial
*   configuration of this component. The variable is initialized to a zero (0u)
*   and set to one (1u) the first time Cy_BLE_Start() is called. This
*   allows for component initialization without re-initialization in all
*   subsequent calls to the Cy_BLE_Start() routine.
